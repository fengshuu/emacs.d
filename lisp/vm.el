;; | op  | usage   | function                    |
;; |-----+---------+-----------------------------|
;; | PSH | psh val | push <val> to stack         |
;; | POP | pop     | pop value from stack        |
;; | add | add     | add top two values on stack |

;; Example:

;; TODO: Implement the improved version (more instructions and registers)
