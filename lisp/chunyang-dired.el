;;; Commentary:

;; Like `find-dired' but works for mdfind, git ls-files etc.

;;; Code:

(require 'dired)

(defun git-ls-files-dired (dir)
  (interactive
   (list (read-directory-name "Run git ls-files in directory: "
                              nil "" t)))

  (setq dir (file-name-as-directory (expand-file-name dir)))
  (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Git ls-files*"))

  (widen)
  (kill-all-local-variables)
  (setq buffer-read-only nil)
  (erase-buffer)
  (setq default-directory dir)

  (shell-command "git ls-files | xargs ls -l" (current-buffer))

  (dired-mode dir "-l")
  (setq-local dired-sort-inhibit t)
  (setq-local revert-buffer-function `(lambda (ignore-auto noconfirm)
                                        (git-ls-files-dired ,dir)))
  (setq-local dired-subdir-alist
